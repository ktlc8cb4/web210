			<h2>Our Community</h2>
			<img class="communityfig" src="images/community.png" alt="Dharma class">
			<p>We currently have a small community of about 160 people who regularly come to participate in our activities. We strive to bring well known masters from around the world to give Dharma Talks at our place. Despite us being a small community, we have had many successful events and have received strong support from our fellow Buddhists from places such as Canada, Vietnam, and other states. We are currently building a larger temple to be able to accommodate more people. We have broken ground in 2017 and plan on moving in 2020.</p>
